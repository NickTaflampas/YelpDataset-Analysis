# YelpDataset-Analysis
This is an exploratory analysis on the course of Data Mining in Computer Science and Engineering University of Ioannina.
The course was completed with perfect grades by Nikos Taflampas.

The analysis by itself focuses on a part of the Yelp Dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset). We focus on all bussinesses in Philladelphia and explore the following:
- Review Count Distribution
- Star Rating over Time
- Correlation between Price Range and Area's Count/Quality
- Correlation between Star Rating and Price Range/Dress Code
- Correlation between Ambience
- Correlation between Area's Price Range and Type
- Correlation between Work Hours and Area's Price Range

Additionally, we train and test several of our data to try to create efficient models that can predict values. Some models are:
- UCF (User-based Collaborative Filtering)
- ICF (Item-based Collaborative Filtering)
- K-Means (with Cluster Analysis and Silhouette Diagrams)
- Agglomerative Clustering (/w several linkage)
- SVD
- Value Propagation
- TF-IDF
- CBOW, Skipgram CBOW and Doc2Vec Embeddings (bonus use of Google Embeddings)
